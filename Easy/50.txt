You are supplied with coordinates X and Y
And a section of text H lines long and W characters across.

Find the character located at X and Y in the text.
Where the first character of the first line is X: 0, Y: 0

The Y increases by 1 per line of text, the X increases by 1 per character in a line.

If the coordinate does not exist, output "Invalid coordinate" instead.

Input
Line 1: An integer H for the number of lines of text.
Line 2: An integer W for the number of characters per line of text.
Line 3: Two integers, the X and Y coordinate of the character to locate.
Next H lines: The text to search, inputted line by line as strings.

Output
A single character at the location of X Y,
Or "Invalid coordinate" if the coordinates provided were not valid.

Constraints
2 ≤ H, W ≤ 50
Potentially valid coordinates:
0 ≤ X, Y ≤ 50

Example
Input
5
10
6 2
(bE+HrU;dP
}H+ayitQa!
$4SCQ,SQF8
h[/y&6D&%}
$rLBZ;+PRq

Output
S




-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//read inputs
const H = parseInt(readline());
const W = parseInt(readline());
const [X, Y] = readline().split(" ").map(Number);

// Check if coordinates are valid
if (X < 0 || X >= W || Y < 0 || Y >= H) {
    console.log("Invalid coordinate");
} else {
    let targetChar;
    for (let i = 0; i < H; i++) {
        const row = readline();
        if (i === Y) {
            targetChar = row[X];
        }
    }
    console.log(targetChar);
}
