In European tunnels, emergency exits need to be within 500 meters of each other. 
You are an inspector following European regulations, inspecting plans for an upcoming tunnel. 
You have listed all of the planned emergency exits, sorted by their distance from one of the 
entrances, and have verified that the first and last exits are close enough to the entrances. 

However, your supervisor tells you that two exits are too far from each other! You need to 
find these two exits, and determine the distance separating them. 

Input 
First line: An integer N for the number of emergency exits. 
Second line: N space-separated integers representing the distance of every emergecy exit to the entrance. 

Output 
First line: The distance between the two emergency exits that are too far apart. 

Constraints 
2 <= N <= 100 

Example 

Input 
3 
200 600 1700 

Output 
1100

//reading input
const n = parseInt(readline());
const exits = readline().split(' ').map(Number);

let maxGap = 0;
for(let i=0;i<n-1;i++){
        let gap = exits[i+1] - exits[i];
        if(gap>maxGap) maxGap = gap;
}

console.log(maxGap);
