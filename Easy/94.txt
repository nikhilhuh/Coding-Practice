Determine the sum of all integer values between inputs 
A and B if A <= B else find the integer difference if A > B.
A and B are included in both totals.

Example
A=5 B=10
should output 45. Since 5 <= 10 perform 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10

A=10 B=5
should output -25. Since 10 > 5 perform 10 - 9 - 8 - 7 - 6 - 5

Input
Line 1 The integer A
Line 2 The integer B

Output
Line 1 A single line containing either the sum or the difference of the values between A and B.

Constraints
-2^31 <= A <= 2^31
-2^31 <= B <= 2^31

Example
Input
1
10

Output
55




-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//read inputs
const A = BigInt(readline());
const B = BigInt(readline());

let result;

if (A <= B) {
  // arithmetic series sum from A to B
  const n = B - A + 1n;
  result = (n * (A + B)) / 2n;
} else {
  // difference case
  const n = A - B;
  const sumBetween = (n * (B + (A - 1n))) / 2n; // sum from B to A-1
  result = A - sumBetween;
}

console.log(result.toString());
