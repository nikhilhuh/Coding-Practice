You are given a string that is already a palindrome. 
Your task is to write a function that reverses the process 
and generates the original string that, when reversed and appended 
to itself (overlapping one character in the middle if needed), 
forms the given palindrome. 

Input 
A single string s that is a palindrome. 

Output 
The original string s' as described in the statement. 

Constraints 
1 ≤ length of s ≤ 10 

Example 
Input 
bob 

Output 
bo




-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//we only have to print the first half of the string as original string

//reading input
const s = readline();
let original = "";

//if length is even original string will be the half of the s (eg: s is "abba" original will be "ab" - half of s)
if(s.length%2 === 0) original = s.slice(0,n/2);
else original = s.slice(0,Math.ceil(n/2));
//if length is odd original string will be the half of the s in integer + 1 (eg: s is "bob" original will be "bo" - half of s in integer + 1)

console.log(original);
