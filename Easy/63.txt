You are a teacher. Your task is to check whether each student’s sentence ends with the correct punctuation.

Rules:

1- If a sentence begins with a question word how, where, when, why, who or what, regardless of whether it is written in uppercase or lowercase, then it must end with ? .
Otherwise, the sentence must end with . .

2- Each sentence that follows the rule is deemed correct.

3- At the end, print the score in the format:
X/N
where X is the number of correct sentences and N is the total number of sentences.

4) If a sentence is wrong, print its corrected version on a new line (print only the correct versions of those sentences that are wrong).

Input
Line 1: An integer N, the number of sentences.
Next N lines: Each line contains a sentence.

Output
Line 1: The score in the form X/N.
Next lines: The corrected version of all wrong sentences (if any), 
each on its own line, in the order given in the input.

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 10
Each sentence contains only words, spaces, and ends with one punctuation mark . or ?.
Sentences will always have more than one word.

Example
Input
1
He is my friend.

Output
1/1

//read input
const N = parseInt(readline());

let correctedSentences = [];
let score = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    const sentence = readline();
    const words = sentence.split(" ");
    const l = sentence.length;
    let isWrong = false;
    let correctedSentence = "";

    if(isQuestion(words[0].toLowerCase())){
        if(sentence.endsWith(".")){
            isWrong = true;
            correctedSentence = sentence.substring(0, l-1) + "?";
        }
    } else {
        if(sentence.endsWith("?")){
            isWrong = true;
            correctedSentence = sentence.substring(0, l-1) + ".";
        }
    }

    if(isWrong){
        correctedSentences.push(correctedSentence);
    } else {
        score++;
    }
}

console.log(`${score}/${N}`);
correctedSentences.forEach((sentence)=>{
    console.log(sentence);
})

function isQuestion(firstWord) {
    const questionWords = ["how", "where", "when", "why", "who", "what"];
    return questionWords.includes(firstWord);
}
