-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//we have print odd numbers in sequence till the input number for if number is 0 or below 0 print 0

//reading input
const m = parseInt(readline()); 

if(m<=0) console.log("0");
else {
        let row = [];
        for(let i =1;i<= m;i=i+2){ 
                row.push(i); 
        } 
        console.log(row.join(" "));
}
