You need to print the sum of factorial of a number and 
the sum of all natural numbers ranging from 1 to the number (both inclusive). 

For example if input is equal to 4, then output should be (4*3*2*1)+4+3+2+1 

Input 
Line 1: A Positive integer n 

Output 
Sum of factorial as well as all integers below the number including number 

Constraints 
1 ≤ n ≤ 25 

Example 
Input 
4 

Output 
34



-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//read input
const n = parseInt(readline());

let sum = 0;
let fact = 1;
for(let i=1;i<=n;i++){
        fact *=i;
        sum +=i;
}

console.log(fact + sum);
