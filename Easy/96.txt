Given the number of sides N of a regular polygon and the length L of each side, 
return the area of this regular polygon, rounded to the closest integer.

Input
Line 1: the number N of sides
Line 2: the length L of each side

Output
Line 1: the area of the regular polygon with N sides of length L, rounded to the closest integer.

Constraints
3 ≤ N ≤ 100
0 ≤ L ≤ 100

Example
Input
4
1

Output
1

//based on math formulae , you could google it as well
//read inputs
const N = parseInt(readline());
const L = parseInt(readline());

if (L === 0) {
  console.log(0);
} else {
  const area = (N * (L ** 2)) / (4 * Math.tan(Math.PI / N));
  console.log(Math.round(area));
}
