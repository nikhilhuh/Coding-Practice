You are a powerful magician-developer moving through a strange valley 
where towers magically appear. Each tower has a height, and you have the 
ability to create or destroy towers. 
- Creating a tower cost the energy same as its height. 
- Destroying a tower gives you the same energy as its height. 

if A is positive, this means you create a tower of height A, which costs you A units of energy. 
If A is negative, this means you destroy a tower of height |A|, which gives you |A| units of energy. 

Your objective is to calculate the energy remaining after performing a series of actions on the towers. 

Input 
Line 1: An integer N for the number of actions to perform. 
Next N lines: An integer A for an action. 

Output 
Line 1: An integer representing the energy remaining after all actions have been performed. 

Constraints 
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4. 
-10^4 ≤ A ≤ 10^4. 

Example 
Input 
5 
4 
-2 
3 
-1 
2 

Output 
-6




-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//read inputs
const N = parseInt(readline());
let energy = 0;

for(let i-1;i<=N;i++){
        const height = parseInt(readline());
        if(height > 0) energy -= A;
        else energy += Math.abs(A);
}

console.log(energy);
