-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//the question wants us to input n- the index of the character in Captial alphabet series(65-90) 
//and print it n- times in one line

//reading input
const n = parseInt(readline());
const s = String.fromCharCode(64 + n).repeat(n);
//64 + n will give us the alphabet (A-Z) at n ( consider n is 1 -> 64 + 1 -> "A") and .repeat will make it repeat n times

console.log(s);
