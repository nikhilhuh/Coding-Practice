You are given a 8 x 8 grid of letters and you have to find the position of character 'c' (case sensitive)
in that grid and print them separated by space. 
Each occurence should be printed.
The indexing of the grid is like a chess board, row starting from 'a' and column from '1'. 

Input 
Line 1: the character 'c' whose indexes has to be found
Next 8 Lines: string s representing 8 elements of the row (non-separated)  

Output 
Positions of the character 'c' in the grid 

Constraints 
'a' || 'A' =< c =< 'z' || 'Z' 

Example 
Input 
L
OOOOLOOO
O1OOOGOL
0001JUOO
LOOOOLLO
OOOOOOOO
OOOOOOOL
OOOOLOOO
OOOOPIOL

Output 
a5 b8 d1 d6 d7 f8 g5 h8



-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//read input
const c = readline();

let positions = [];
for(let i=1;i<=8;i++){
        const s = readline().split("");

        s.forEach((ch, idx)=>{
                if(ch === c) positions.push(`${String.fromCharCode(96 + i)}${idx + 1}`);
        })
}

console.log(positions.join(" "));
