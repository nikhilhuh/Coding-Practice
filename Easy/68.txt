You get a character c and a string s.
Your task is to print the sum of all indexes of c in s. The index of the first character is 0!

Example:
c = o
s = hello world

"o" is the fifth and the eighth character: Index 4 + Index 7 = 11

Input
Line 1: A character c
Line 2: A string s

Output
Line 1: The sum of all indexes of c in s. Pay attention on UPPER- and lowercase.

Constraints
Length of c = 1
1 ≤ length of s ≤ 200

Example
Input
e
hello

Output
1




-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//read input
const c = readline();
const s = readline().split("");

let sum = 0;
s.forEach((ch, i)=> {
    if(ch === c) sum+=i;
})
console.log(sum);
