-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//Three numbers are input in separate lines
const a = parseInt(readline());
const b = parseInt(readline());
const c = parseInt(readline());

//The question states that we have to print the number among the three numbers that are not repeated
if(a===b) console.log(c);
else if(a===c) console.log(b);
else console.log(a);
