A stationary rocket is launched and travels with a constant acceleration 
of 2 m/sÂ² (meters per second squared).
This means that every second the rocket's speed increases by 2 meters per second.

The rocket reaches its goal in n seconds.

Print the distance traveled (in meters) by the rocket.

Input
n: an integer representing the duration of the rocket's flight (in seconds)

Output
d : the distance traveled by the rocket (in meters)

Constraints
0 < n < 10000

Example
Input
101

Output
10201




-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//read inputs
const t = parseInt(readline());

//to calculate distance the formula is -> vo + ((a* t^2)/2) 
//since initial velocity is 0 so distance will be a * t^2 /2 and a is 2 so d is t^2

const distance = t * t;
console.log(distance);
