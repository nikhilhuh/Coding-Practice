Given the value N you need to give the sum of all positive integers 
smaller or equal to N that are divisible by 3 or 5. 
But be aware numbers like 15 should not be double-counted.

Input
An integer N

Output
Sum of positive integers smaller than or equal to N that are divisible by 3 or 5

Constraints
0<= N <= 10000

Example
Input
3

Output
3




-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//read input
const N = parseInt(readline());
let sum = 0;

for(let i=1;i<N;i++){
        if(i%3 === 0 || i%5 ===0 ) sum += i;
}

console.log(sum);
