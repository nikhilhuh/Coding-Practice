In an ancient library, a teacher discovers a strange manuscript.
Every word in it seems to be the result of a battle between vowels and consonants.

Given a single lowercase word s, output:
1. the number of vowels (letters in a,e,i,o,u,y)
2. the number of consonants (all other letters in a..z)
Print the two numbers on one line, separated by a space.

Input
Line 1: A lowercase string s (a–z only).

Output
Line 1: Two integers: vowels then consonants, separated by a space.

Constraints
1 ≤ length of s ≤ 10

Example

Input
aeiouyaeio

Output
10 0




-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//reading string as input and converting to array , bcoz i love working on array
const s = readline().split("");

//maing a vowels string to check if the characters is in this string or not
const vowels = "aeiouy";

let countVowels = 0;
let countConsonants = 0;

s.forEach((ch)=>{
    if(vowels.includes(ch)) countVowels++;
    else if(ch>='a' && ch<='z') countConsonants++;
})

console.log(countVowels, countConsonants);
