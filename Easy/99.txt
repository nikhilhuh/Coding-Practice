You must output for each participant in a race the traveled distance 
(in meters) at a given speed S (centimeters/second) in given amount of 
time T (minutes).

INPUT:
Line 1: An integer N for the number of participants.
Next N lines: Two space separated integers S and T representing respectively 
the speed S and the time T.
 
OUTPUT:
N Lines: An Integer representing the distance traveled.
 
CONSTRAINTS:
0 ≤ S ≤ 150
0 ≤ T ≤ 100000
 
EXAMPLE:
Input
1
20 10

Output
120
 




-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//read inputs
const N = parseInt(readline());

for(let i=0;i<N;i++){
        const [S, T] = readline().split(" ").map(Number);

        const distance = Math.floor((S * T * 60) / 100); //speed * time is distance and converting into meters

        console.log(disatnce);
}
