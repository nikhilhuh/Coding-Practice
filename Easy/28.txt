You have to find the biggest terrain in a list and output its terrainId. 
A terrain is a rectangle and its area is equal to width * height.

Input 
The first line : terrainCount : the number of terrains. 
The next terrainCount lines : Each terrain has 3 integers : 
a width, a height and a terrainId separated by spaces. 

Output 
The terrainId of the biggest terrain. 

Constraints 
0 < terrainCount < 20
0 < width, height < 1000 
All terrains have different areas in each case.

Example 
Input 
3 
5 10 0 
6 9 1 
7 8 2 

Output 
2

//reading input
const terrainCount = parseInt(readline());

let maxArea = -1;
let maxTerrainId = -1;

for(let i=0;i<terrainCount;i++){
        const [height, width, terrainId] = readline().split(" ");
        const area = height * width;

        if(area > maxArea){
                maxArea = area;
                maxTerrainId = terrainId;
        }
}

console.log(maxTerrainId);
