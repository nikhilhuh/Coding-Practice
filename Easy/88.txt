//read input
let suits = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  suits.push(parseInt(readline()));
}

let counts = {};
for (let s of suits) counts[s] = (counts[s] ?? 0) + 1;

let maxCount = Math.max(...Object.values(counts));

if (maxCount === 5) console.log(5);
else if (maxCount === 4) console.log(4);
else console.log(0);
