The arithmetic mean (or mean or average) is the most commonly used and readily 
understood measure of central tendency. In statistics, the term average refers to 
any of the measures of central tendency. 

The arithmetic mean is defined as being equal to the sum of the numerical values 
of each and every observation divided by the total number of observations. 

For this mission, you are given a non-empty list of natural numbers. 
You must compute their arithmetic mean. 

Input 
Line 1: The number of values in the list, N 
Line 2: N space separated integers (each called X) 

Output 
Line 1: The arithmetic mean of the list as a float or an integer 

Constraints 
2 ≤ N ≤ 100 
-1000 < X < 1000 

Example 

Input 
5 
1 2 3 4 5 

Output 
3

//reading input
const n = parseInt(readline());
const sum = readline().split(" ").map(Number).reduce(( acc, value) => acc + value, 0);
const average = sum / n;

console.log(average);
