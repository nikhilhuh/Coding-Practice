Write a program to merge lines of numbers whose sum is even. 
Each line may contain a different amount of numbers. 

Input 
Line 1: An integer N for the number of next lines. 
Next N lines: Space separated numbers (only integers). 

Output 
The concatenation of lines whose sum is even in the same order as input, separated by a space. 
0 if there is no even lines. 

Constraints 
2 ≤ N ≤ 20 
0 ≤ number ≤ 100 

Example 
Input 
2 
1 2 3 
4 5 6 

Output 
1 2 3

//read inputs
const N = parseInt(readline());

let result = [];
for (let i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    const line = readline().split(" ").map(Number);
    const sum = line.reduce((acc,value)=> acc + value,0);

    if(sum%2===0) result.push(...line);
}

console.log(result.length? result.join(" ") : "0")
