Find each occurrence of word 'the' in the input string, case insensitive, and count them. 
The word the has to be its own word, and not a part of another word: 
e.g. 'furthermore' doesn't count. 

Input 
The input is a string of plain text English containing, among others, the word 'the'. 

Output 
Number of occurrences of the word the in the string given as input 

Constraints 
0 < length of input < 1024 

Example 
Input 
The goal of this challenge is to find a particular word. 

Output 
1




-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//read input
const s = readline();

// Use regex to match whole word 'the', case-insensitive
const matches = s.match(/\bthe\b/gi);
//explanation of this ->
// \b ensures “the” is matched as a whole word.
// i flag makes it case-insensitive.
// g flag allows matching all occurrences.

const count = matches? matches.length : 0;

console.log(count);
