Your task is to write a program that calculates the total calories from a meal. You will be given a list of foods with their calorie values and a separate list of what was eaten.

Input
Line 1: An integer N for the number of items in the food database.
Next N lines: A word food_name and an integer calories per serving for each food item.
Next line: An integer M for the number of food items consumed.
Next M lines: A word consumed_food and an integer servings for each consumed item.

Output
Line 1: A single integer representing the total calories consumed.

Constraints
1≤ N ≤10
0≤ M ≤10
0≤ calories ≤1000
1≤ servings ≤10
food_name does not contain any space characters.
Every food_name in the list of calories in food is unique.
consumed_food is always one of the food_names

Example
Input
3
apple 95
banana 105
sandwich 400
2
apple 1
sandwich 2

Output
895

//read input
const N = parseInt(readline());
let food = {};

for (let i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    const [name , calories] = readline().split(' ');
    food[name] = calories;
}

const M = parseInt(readline());
let totalCalories = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < M; i++) {
    const [name , servings] = readline().split(' ');
    totalCalories += food[name] * servings;
}


console.log(totalCalories);
