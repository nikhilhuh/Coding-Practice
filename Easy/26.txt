A student is typing notes very quickly and often forgets to use the correct case for letters.
He wants a program that will automatically switch the case of every character in his notes:

If a character is lowercase, convert it to uppercase.
If a character is uppercase, convert it to lowercase.
Any non-alphabetical character (digits, punctuation, spaces) should remain unchanged.

INPUT:
A single line string s containing letters, digits, spaces, or punctuation.

OUTPUT:
The string with the case of every letter toggled.

CONSTRAINTS:
0 < length of s â‰¤ 1000

EXAMPLE:
Input
Hello World!

Output
hELLO wORLD!




-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//reading input
const s = readline();

for(let ch of s){
        if (ch >= 'a' && ch <= 'z') result += ch.toUpperCase();
        else if (ch >= 'A' && ch <= 'Z') result += ch.toLowerCase();
        else result += ch;  // keep non-letters unchanged
}

console.log(s);
