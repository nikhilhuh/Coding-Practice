The nucleotides inside a DNA sequence can be represented by a string composed by A, C, G and T. 
A sample string representing a DNA sequence is "ATGCTTCAGAAAAGGTCAGCG". 
Your task is to count how many times the symbols A, C, G and T appear in the string s. 

INPUT:
A single line, composed of A, C, G and T. 

OUTPUT: 
The number of times A, C, G and T appear in the string s, separated by a space. 

CONSTRAINTS: 
0 < len(s) < 1000 

EXAMPLE: 
Input 
AACT 

Output 
2 1 0 1 




-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//reading inputs
const s = readline();

//making an object to store count of each character
let count = {
        A: 0,
        C: 0,
        G: 0,
        T: 0
}

for(let ch of s) {
        if(count[ch] !== undefined){
                count[ch]++;
        }
}

console.log(count['A'],count['C'],count['G'],count['T']);
