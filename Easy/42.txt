The government of the fictional country, New Fa, has an unusual system 
of age calculation. Whenever a person's birthday is, the person's age in 
years increases by one on the New Year's Day. 

For example, 
Emma's birth date was December 31st, 2022, so Emma became 1-year-old on January 1st, 2023. 

As another example - 
John's birthday is January 1st, so he became 1-year-old on the day he was born. 

Given the birthDate of a person, your task is to output the age of the person 
in years using New Fa government's age calculation system. 

For example, 
if birthDate is 2022/12/31 and year is 2023, the output should be 1. 

Input 
Line 1: A string birthDate in the format of YYYY/MM/DD of a person 
Line 2: An integer year 

Output 
Line 1 : The age of the person as of year 

Constraints 
0 â‰¤ year < 10000 
year is always the person's birthyear or later. 

Example 
Input 
2022/12/31
2023

Output 
1

//read inputs
const [birthYear, birthMonth, birthDay] =  readline().split("/").map(Number);
const currYear = parseInt(readline());

const age = currYear - birthYear;
if(birthMonth === 1 && birthDay === 1) age++;

console.log(age);
