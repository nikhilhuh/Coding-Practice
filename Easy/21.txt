You are in a Mathematics class. 
The teacher has just taught you how to add, multiply and square. 
Now, the teacher gives you x numbers n (x is odd) and 
asks you to find the product of the sum of odd numbers and the sum of even numbers. 
Furthermore, he wants you to add the square of the middle number to the result. 

To prevent cheating, he wants you to show your steps in this format: 
Sum(even) x Sum(odd) + middle^2 = result 

P.S. Please look at the output format. 

Input 
Line 1: an integer x, the size of the numbers list. 
Line 2: x space-separated integers n. 

Output 
The steps in one line following the required format. 

Constraints 
x is odd 
-100 < n < 100 

Example 
Input 
9 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

Output 
20 x 16 + 4^2 = 336




-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//reading inputs
const x = parseInt(readline());
const numbers = readline().split(" ").map(Number);

let even = 0;
let odd = 0;

numbers.forEach((n)=>{
        if(n%2===0) even+=n;
        else odd+=n;
})

const middle = numbers[Math.floor(x/2)];

const result = even * odd + Math.pow(middle,2);

console.log(`${even} x ${odd} + ${middle}^2 = ${result}`);
