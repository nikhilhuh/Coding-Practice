-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//read input
const input = readline();
let count = {};

for(let ch of input){
    count[ch] = (count[ch] ?? 0) + 1;
}

const [a,b] = Object.keys(count).filter(ch => count[ch] === 1);

let result = "";
for(let ch of input){
    if(ch === a) result += b;
    else if(ch === b) result += a;
    else result += ch;
}

console.log(result);
