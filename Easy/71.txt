In a distant land, a treasure map is given to you in the form of a string. 
The string contains characters representing the directions to follow: 
N: North 
S: South 
E: East 
W: West 
Each character indicates a step in that direction. 
Your task is to determine the final coordinates of the treasure starting from the origin (0, 0). 
Moving N increases the y-coordinate by 1. 
Moving S decreases the y-coordinate by 1. 
Moving E increases the x-coordinate by 1. 
Moving W decreases the x-coordinate by 1. 

You need to output the final coordinates as a string in the format "(x, y)". 

Input 
A single string containing characters N,S,E and W. 

Output 
A string representing the final coordinates in the format "(x,y)". 

Constraints 
Example 
Input 
NNESW 

Output 
(0,1)




-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//read input
const directions = readline();

let x= 0;
let y= 0;

for(let ch of directions){
        if(ch === "N") y++;
        else if(ch === "S") y--;
        else if(ch === "E") x++;
        else if(ch === "S") x--;
}

console.log(`(${x},${y})`);
