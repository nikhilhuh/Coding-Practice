CodinGame.com is an online platform for programmers to improve their coding skills through game-based challenges and puzzles.

The site has a "leveling" system – by doing various activities you gain XP and once you get enough XP you get promoted to the next level. Specifically, to get from level L - 1 to level L you need (rounded down)
(L ^ 1.5) * 10 XP

For example, to go from level 2 to level 3 you need
3^1.5*10 = 51.96152423 ≈ 51 additional XP.

Your task is to implement the algorithm that determines how much more XP a player needs to level up.

Input
Line 1: An integer level for the level the user is currently on.
Line 2: An integer xp for the amount of XP the user has collected since reaching level

Output
The amount of XP the user has to gain to reach the next level (as an integer), or LEVEL UP if the user already has enough XP to level up.

Constraints
1 ≤ level ≤ 100
0 ≤ XP ≤ 10000

Example
Input
2
0

Output
51

//read input
const level = parseInt(readline());
const xp = parseInt(readline());

const next = level + 1;
const xpRequired = Math.floor(Math.pow(next, 1.5) * 10);

if (xp >= xpRequired) {
    console.log("LEVEL UP");
} else {
    console.log(xpRequired - xp);
}
