We define a transformation of digits as being from "0123456789" to "9876543210".
You're given N digits as input. Please transform the digits in a similar way.
For example, if you're given the digit 1, you should output the digit 8.

Input
Line 1: An integer N for the number of digits to input.
Next N lines: X as the digit.

Output
Next N lines: The transformation of X

Constraints
0 ≤ X ≤ 9

Example
Input
1
8

Output
1




-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//read inputs
const N = parseInt(readline());

for(let i=0;i<N;i++){
        const X = parseInt(readline());
        console.log(9 - X);
}
