Print the product of all found indices. 
Given a string S (input line 1) and a line of space separated characters 
CHARS (input line 2), you must output the product (multiplication result) 
of all the indices (index plural) of the given characters of CHARS found in S. 

Output "NONE" if no characters of CHARS are found in S. 
Note: in CHARS, ignore the spaces between non-whitespace characters. 
The spaces are not to be considered as playing characters in this clash. 
Note 2: The characters in CHARS and S are Case Sensitive. 

Example: 
Input 
Line 1: S = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" 
Line 2: CHARS = "h q n" 

Output 
1792 
Because h's indices are 1 & 32, q's index is 4 and n's index is 14, and 1*32*4*14 = 1792. 

Input 
Line 1: A string S. 
Line 2: A string CHARS, a line of space separated characters . 

Output 
Line 1: The product of every character of CHARS's index in S. 

Output "NONE" if no characters of CHARS are found in S. 

Constraints 
0 ≤ S ≤ 100 
0 ≤ CHARS < 10 

Example 
Input 
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog 
h q n 

Output 
1792

//read inputs
const s = readline();
const chars = readline().split(" ");

let product = 1;
let found = false;

for(let ch of chars){
        for(let i=0; i<=s.length; i++){
                if(s[i] === ch){
                        product *= i;
                        found = true;
                }
        }
}

if(found) console.log(product);
else console.log("NONE");
