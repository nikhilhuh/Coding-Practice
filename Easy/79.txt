Cody is a programmer, who likes to make CoC's. 
He must carry out long, tedious, and boring tasks just to get his contribution 
to the company accepted. If he gets it approved unanimously by any three passers-by, 
his contribution will be uploaded into the community's "CoC" database. 
If he does not get it approved, he will be humiliatingly "laid off".

Cody has n days left to get it validated.
Each day, he fixes f errors.
Each day, he gets e new errors.
If Cody has less than 5 errors at the deadline, his contribution will be accepted.
If he has 5 to 9 errors, his contribution will be rejected.
If he has 10 errors or more, Cody will be fired.

Can he get his contribution approved in time?
If he can output: Contribution Accepted!
If he can't output: Contribution Rejected!
Otherwise output: CODY. YOU'RE SACKED, FIRED AND KICKED OUT OF THE COMMUNITY!!!

!PLEASE NOTE THAT CODY ALWAYS STARTS WITH 0 ERRORS AT THE START OF DAY 1!
Input
Line 1: n the number of days left before the deadline.
Line 2: f the number of errors he fixes each day.
Line 3: e the number of errors that pop up each day.
Output
# The corresponding message. #
Constraints
n, f and e are always integers.

0 <= n, f and e <= 10
Example
Input
10
2
1

Output
Contribution Accepted!
 




-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//read input
const n = parseInt(readline());
const f = parseInt(readline());
const e = parseInt(readline());

const errors = Math.max(0, n*e - n*f); 
//because errors left can't be less than 0

if(errors >= 10) console.log("CODY. YOU'RE SACKED, FIRED AND KICKED OUT OF THE COMMUNITY!!!");
else if(errors >= 5) console.log("Contribution Rejected!");
else console.log("Contribution Accepted!");
