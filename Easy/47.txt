You must help Gary move X boxes. 
He can carry one box per N minutes, but he only has T hours to do so. 
You promised to help, but since you're very lazy, you will only carry 
the minimum number of boxes that are required for Gary to finish. 

Input 
Line 1: int X 
Line 2: int N 
Line 3: int T 

Output 
A single integer, representing the number of boxes you must carry. 

Constraints 
0 <= X < 1000 
0 < N < 61 
0 <= T <= 24 

Example 
Input 
12 
10 
0 

Output 
12

//read inputs
const X = parseInt(readline());
const N = parseInt(readline());
const T = parseInt(readline());

const boxesGaryCanCarry = Math.floor(T*60 / N);
const boxesINeedToCarry = Math.max(0, X - boxesGaryCanCarry);

console.log(boxesINeedToCarry);
