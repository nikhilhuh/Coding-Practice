You are given a sequence of operations that modify a variable x.
The variable x starts at 0.

Each operation is one of the following:

x++ → increase x by 1

++x → increase x by 1

x-- → decrease x by 1

--x → decrease x by 1

Determine the final value of x after performing all operations.

Input
Line 1: An integer n representing the number of operations.
Next n lines: A string operation representing one operation (x++, ++x, x--, or --x).

Output
Line 1: Print a single integer — the final value of x.

Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 100

Example

Input
4
x++
++x
--x
--x

Output
0




-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//reading input 
const n = parseInt(readline());

//starting x at 0
let x = 0;
for(let i =0; i<n;i++){
        const operation = readline();
        if(operation.includes("++")) x+=1;
        else x-=1;
}

consoel.log(x);
