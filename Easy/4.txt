Find the nth digit in a string of all palindromic numbers
'123456789112233445566778899101'.... 

Notes: - Palindromic numbers are numbers that are palindromes (ex. 101, 202) 

If you get 1 as input you must print 1 as the first character in the string is 1 

Input Line 1
n, an integer 

Output Line 1
ans, an integer 

Constraints 
0 < n < 1000 

Example 

Input 
1 

Output 
1




-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//question says that we have to find the 'n'-th digit of all the palindromic numbers till 'n'
//basiclly 'n' is the length of the series we have to generate

//first read input of 'n'
const n = parseInt(readline());

//now lets make a function to find if the number is palindrome or not
function isPalindrome(num) {
        let s = num.toString(); //converting num to string for converting to array by split and using reverse on array
        return s === s.split("").reverse().join(""); //returns if the number is palindrome or not 
}

//generating palindromic series until length >='n'
let s = "";
let i = 0;
while (s.length < n) {
        if(isPalindrome(i)) s += i.toString();
        i++;
}

//output the n-th digit (nth digit in indexing will be n-1)
console.log(s[n - 1]);
