Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle, a, b and c, calculate the perimeter of said triangle if it is a RIGHT triangle (one angle is 90°).

If the three side lengths given are not able to form a RIGHT triangle, print invalid. This could be the case if either
• A length is negative or zero
• The lengths are mismatched. You might test this using the Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c²

Hint: You don't really need to google any formulas for this one. Perimeter = a+b+c

Input
Line 1: An integer a containing the length of side a.
Line 2: An integer b containing the length of side b.
Line 3: An integer c containing the length of side c.

Output
Line 1 : The perimeter of the triangle or the string literal invalid.

Constraints
a, b, c are all integers
a + b + c <= 3000

Example

Input
3
4
5

Output
12




-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//read inputs
const a = parseInt(readline());
const b = parseInt(readline());
const c = parseInt(readline());

//only checking if sides are greater than 0 and if c^2 = a^2 + b^2 as question says that otherwise we would have checked 
//all three cases of c^2 = a^2 + b^2 or a^2 = b^2 + c^2 or b^2 = a^2 + c^2

if (a > 0 && b > 0 && c > 0 && a*a + b*b === c*c) {
    console.log(a + b + c);
} else {
    console.log("invalid");
}
