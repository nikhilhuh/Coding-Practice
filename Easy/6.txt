You are given a sequence seq of distinct integers. 
Consider the inclusive range from the smallest to the largest value in seq (step = 1). 
Output how many integers in that range are missing from seq. 

Input 
A space-separated string sequence seq of distinct integers. 

Output 
An integer representing the numbers of missing integers. 

Constraints 
1 ≤ length(seq) ≤ 512 
-1000 ≤ value in seq ≤ 1000 
All values in seq are distinct 
Input may be in any order 

Example 

Input 
-5 -1 3 7 

Output 
9




-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//reading input of numbers separated by spaces and making it an array
const seq = readline().split(" ");

//finding the max and min in the array
const max = Math.max(...seq);
const min = Math.min(...seq);

//finding the difference between them and adding one (inclusive)- this will tell us the total elements which should be 
//there in the sequence (eg- in sequence from 1-5 there are 6 total elements ( 5 - 1 + 1))
const total = max - min + 1;

//finding the missing elements number 
const missing = total - seq.length;

console.log(missing);
