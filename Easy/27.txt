You are given the set of whole euro bills and coins: 
€500, €200, €100, €50, €20, €10, €5, €2, €1 and an integer sum. 
Your task is to find out how to pay the sum with the least number of coins/bills. 

For each bill/coin in the euro set, print the number of times 
you need this bill/coin on its own line. 

Input 
Line 1: an integer sum. 

Output 
Line 1: the number of €500 bills needed. 
Line 2: the number of €200 bills needed. 
Line 3: the number of €100 bills needed. 
Line 4: the number of €50 bills needed. 
Line 5: the number of €20 bills needed. 
Line 6: the number of €10 bills needed. 
Line 7: the number of €5 bills needed.

for(let d of denominations){
        let count = Math.floor(sum/d);
        console.log(count);
