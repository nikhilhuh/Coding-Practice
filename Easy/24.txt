A student has many classes and activities, causing him to have very little free time. 
He wants to balance playing video games and studying. 
If he can fit both in his free time, output OK. 
If he cannot fit it in his free time, he will cut back on his video game time. 
Output how long he can play video games to fit it in his free time. 

Input 
Line 1: An integer n for the hours of free time he has. 
Line 2: An integer v for the hours he wants to spend gaming. 
Line 3: An Integer s for the hours he wants to spend studying. 

Output 
Line 1: OK If it can fit in his free time, or how long he can play video games to fit everything in his free time. 

Constraints 
0 <= n, v, s <= 24 

Example 
Input 
24 
8 
10 

Output 
OK 




-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//reading inputs
const n = parseInt(readline());
const v = parseInt(readline()); 
const s = parseInt(readline()); 

if( n >= v + s) console.log("OK");
else console.log(Math.max(0,n - s)); //video game time -> free time - studying time
//using math.max to avoid negative answers as studying time can be more than free time as well , in that case no video 
//game time obviously as there is nit enough time to even study
