You need to calculate if it is possible to fuel up a spaceship within the number of 
seconds allowed(t), given the capacity of the tank (c) in litres, and the number of 
litres of fuel that can be pumped into its tank per second (r). 
The tank starts empty. 
The maximum amount of litres per second (r) is constantly pumped into the tank until it is full. 

Input Line 1: 
Three space seperated integers t, c, and r. 

Output Line 1: 
An string "yes" or "no". 
"yes" if it is possible to fill up the spaceship in the time allowed, "no" if it is not possible. 

Constraints 
0 < t ≤ 10,000 
0 < c ≤ 10,000 
0 < r ≤ 1000 

Example 

Input 
5 3 1 
Output 
yes 




-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//Taking three inputs that are space separated
const [t,c,r] = readline().split(" ");

if(r * t >= c) console.log("yes");
else console.log("no");
