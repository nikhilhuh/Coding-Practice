Your program must perform a binary AND on two binary numbers 
given through the standard input and print the result to the standard output.

Warning, the number of binary digits must remain the same.

Input
2 binary numbers n1 and n2, each on a separate line.

Output
The result of an AND between n1 and n2.

Constraints
n1 and n2 have the same number of digits.

Example
Input
001
011

Output
001




-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//read inputs
const n1 = readline();
const n2 = readline();

let result = "";
for(let i=0;i<n1.length;i++){
        if(n1[i] === "1" && n2[i] === "1") result += "1";
        else result += "0";
}

console.log(result);
