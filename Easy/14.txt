You are given a string of digits. 
Your task is to rearrange the digits such that 
all even digits come first, followed by all odd digits, 
while maintaining their relative order. 

Input 
Line 1: A string S of digits (0-9) 

Output 
Line 1: The reordered string 

Constraints 
1 ≤ length of S ≤ 100 

Example 
Input 
4231576 

Output 
4263157




-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//read input
const S = readline();
let even = "";
let odd = "";
for(let ch of S){
        if(parseInt(ch) % 2 === 0) even+=ch;
        else odd+=ch;
}

console.log(`${even}${odd}`);
