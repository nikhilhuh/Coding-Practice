You are given a sequence of N integers. 
Every element of the sequence can be paired with another 
element that is equal to it, except for one number. 

Your task is to find that singular integer. 
Every element can be in at most one pair and it is guaranteed that 
there is only one number that can't be paired. 

INPUT 
Line 1: an integer N 
Line 2: N space-separated integers 

OUTPUT 
Line 1: an integer, the element that can't be paired 

CONSTRAINTS 
1 ≤ N ≤ 100 
1 ≤ every integer of the sequence ≤ 100 

EXAMPLE 
Input 
5 
2 4 2 4 1 

Output 
1


-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//We have numbers where every element appears in pairs except for one number that appears once.
//We need to find that single number.

//read input
const N = parseInt(readline());
const arr = readline().split(" ").map(Number);

let result = 0;
for (let num of arr) {
    result ^= num; // XOR cancels out pairs
}

console.log(result);
