Wwe have num as an input, we want you to print the sum of numbers 
which are divisible by 7 (from 1 to num (Inclusive)) 

Input 
A number which is num 

Output 
print the sum of numbers which are divisible by 7 (from 1 to num (Inclusive)) 

Constraints 
1<= num <= 200 

Example 
Input

Output 
147 




-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//reading input
const num = parseInt(readline()); 
let sum = 0;
for(let i=7;i<=num;i=i+7){ 
        sum+=i;
}

console.log(sum);
