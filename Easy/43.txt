Given a string line1 and a string line2 which is line1 reversed with some replaced characters, 
output the amount of characters that have been replaced. 

For example, 
for: line1 = 'Hello world!' line2 = '!dlqow olfeH' 
line2 is line1 reversed but with the first l from 'Hello' and the r from 'world!' replaced. 
The expected output is 2. 
All characters are ASCII. 

Input 
Line 1: a sentence. 
Line 2: line1 reversed, with some replaced characters. 

Output 
The amount of replaced characters in line2. 

Constraints 
0 < len(line1) â‰¤ 200 
len(line1) = len(line2) 

Example 
Input 
Hello world! 
!dlqow olfeH 

Output 
2




-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//read inputs
const line1 = readline();
const line2 = readline();

const actualLine2 = line1.split("").reversed().join("");

let count = 0;
for(let i=0;i<line1.length;i++){
        if(actualLine2[i] !== line2[i]) count++;
}
console.log(count);
