Write a program or function that takes 2 whole numbers (p1 and p2) from user input. With those two variables, take a sum of all even numbers from p1 to p2, including those 2 numbers.

Example:
Inputs:
p1 = 1

p2 = 10

Result:
result = 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30


If p1 is bigger than p2, just print 0, but if it is equals, still print the result

Hine: Make it work with large integers as well

Input
p1 : A number (64-bit signed integer) to start from
p2 : A number (64-bit signed integer) to end with

Output
Line 1 : Sum of even numbers in between number p1 and number p2 (including those 2 numbers)

Constraints
p1 and p2 are whole numbers.
p1 should be lower than (or equal to) p2

Example
Input
1
10

Output
30




-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//read inputs
const p1 = BigInt(readline());
const p2 = BigInt(readline());

if (p1 > p2) console.log(0)
else {
    let start = p1 % 2n === 0n ? p1 : p1 + 1n;
    let end = p2 % 2n === 0n ? p2 : p2- 1n;
    
    const count = ((end - start) / 2n) + 1n;
    const sum = (start + end) * count / 2n;
    console.log(sum.toString());

}
