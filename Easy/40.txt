-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//read input
const b = parseInt(readline());
const p = parseInt(readline());
const r = parseInt(readline());
const t = parseInt(readline());

const totalNeeded = p * r * t;

if(b > totalNeeded) console.log("Enough bread");
else if(b == totalNeeded) console.log("Just enough bread");
else console.log("Not enough bread");
