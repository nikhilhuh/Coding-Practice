The shadoks only know four words: GA, BU, ZO and MEU. 
They use these four words to say the numbers. 

For example: 
0 is GA, 1 is BU, 2 is ZO and 3 is MEU. 4 is BUGA, 5 is BUBU, 
8 is ZOGA, 16 is BUGAGA and so on. 

Input 
A non-negative integer N 

Output 
The shadok word for this number 

Constraints 
0 <= N < 10^9 

Example 
Input 
0 

Output 
GA 




-------Only see the solution after putting your efforts into it---------

//read input
const N = parseInt(readline());

const word = {
        0: "GA",
        1: "BU",
        2: "ZO",
        3: "MEU",
}

if(N === 0){
        console.log("GA");
} else {
        let result = "";
        let num = N;

        //convert to base - 4
        const parts = [];
        while (num > 0){
                parts.push(word[num % 4]);
                num = Math.floor(num / 4);
        }

        // Reverse to get correct order
        result = parts.reverse().join("");

        console.log(result);
}
